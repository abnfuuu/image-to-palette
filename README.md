# PalettePix: Color Palette Generator

Welcome to the PalettePix repository! PalettePix is an innovative web application designed to inspire and assist designers, artists, and anyone in need of color inspiration. By simply uploading a photo, users can effortlessly extract a color palette, tapping into an infinite array of colors that nature and their surroundings offer.

This project is crafted with love using Vite, ReactJS, and TailwindCSS.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine. Bun is a fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime that PalettePix uses for managing dependencies and running the development server.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/abnvlf/image-to-palette.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```sh
    cd image-to-palette
    ```
3. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

### Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the website locally using the following command:

```sh
bun dev
```

This command starts the development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port is shown in your terminal) to view the application.
